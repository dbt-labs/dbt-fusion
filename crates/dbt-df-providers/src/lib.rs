//! DataFusion provider implementations backed by the dbt schema store.

//! These types bridge the gap between canonicalized schemas persisted by
//! `dbt-schema-store` and DataFusion's catalog/table abstractions.  They lazily
//! provision catalogs, schemas, and table providers so that the Fusion runtime
//! can rely on consistent schema resolution without pre-registering every table.
