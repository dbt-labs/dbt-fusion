//! Resolver is a crate for resolving a dbt project. It is responsible
//! for resolving all project source files (i.e. models, seeds, tests, macros etc.)
//! and propagating all configuration properties.
//!
//! The result of resolution is a "parse" phase `manifest.json`, whereby
//! "parse" is used to describe the pre-compiled manifest output, which
//! features the results of having rendered the dbt sql to extract the
//! full project configuration.
