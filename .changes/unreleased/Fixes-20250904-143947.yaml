    Add Google Drive scope for service account authentication in BigQuery adapter

    Service accounts can now access Google Sheets as external tables by including the necessary Google Drive OAuth scope (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive) alongside BigQuery and Cloud Platform scopes. This resolves the "Permission denied while getting Drive credentials" error when using service account authentication with Google Sheets external tables.

    This change brings dbt-fusion's service account authentication in line with dbt-core's implementation for accessing Google Drive resources through BigQuery.
