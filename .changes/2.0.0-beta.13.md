### Fixes

- Improved dbt Fusion show stability for VS Code extension previews by removing schema / type checking

- Fixed duplicate model name parsing bug ([#63](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/63))
- Added support for `DBT_PROFILES_DIR` and other env vars in dbt LSP and `profiles.yml`
- Added support for `add_query` adapter method in Databricks
- Added support for Date32/64 and Time32/64 types in dbt Fusion Agate (`stfrtime` method for example). Partially addressed [#79](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-fusion/issues/79)

- Fixed issue where `static_analysis` config is not respected in YML
